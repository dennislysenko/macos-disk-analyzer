# To Do 

- Be able to re-run a folder from the browser (OmniDiskSweeper style ngl kind of a straight copy)
- Be able to delete a folder from the browser?
- Would be dope to be able to show a pie chart at each level (maybe also relative to the total space taken)
- Would be dope to show free space on the drive and keep updating it
- Would be kinda cool to have a "goal" for space to free up
